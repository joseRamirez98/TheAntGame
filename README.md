# TheAntGame

## Background 
This assignment is a semester long project for Dr. Gordon's CSC 133 class (Object-Oriented Computer Graphics Programming) at Sacramento State University. 
## Introduction for Part 1
This semester we will study object-oriented graphics programming and design by developing a simple video game we’ll call ThePath. In this game, you (the player) will be controlling an ant walking around a path while trying to avoid collisions with spiders and to keep your ant fed.


The goal of this first assignment is to develop a good initial class hierarchy and control structure by designing the program in UML and then implementing it in Codename One (CN1). This version will use keyboard input commands to control and display the contents of a “game world” containing the set of objects in the game. In future assignments, many of the keyboard commands will be replaced by interactive GUI operations, and we will add graphics, animation, and sound. For now we will simply simulate the game in “text mode” with user input coming from the keyboard and “output” being lines of text on the screen.
